Furthermore it will deal with correlation and the risk of\nconfusing correlation with causation.\n\nTo demonstrate this, a spurious correlation is plotted.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='04_causality_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_cebcb29e9277aca7b5bd3abd12fcbaa4'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04_causality_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis spurious correlation *\"shows\"* that the number of worldwide non-comercial space launches\ncorrelates to the number of sociology doctorates awarded in the US.\n\nOne can easily figure out that there shouldn't be any correlation between these two.\n\nThe data is from the following website: <https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations>",
