title: "Causality"
---

This section will deal with the topic of causality. This means the way one event 
influences another event. Furthermore it will deal with correlation and the risk of
confusing correlation with causation.

To demonstrate this, a spurious correlation is plotted.

This spurious correlation *"shows"* that the number of worldwide non-comercial space launches
correlates to the number of sociology doctorates awarded in the US.

One can easily figure out that there shouldn't be any correlation between these two.
